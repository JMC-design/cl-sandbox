Overview
--------

Sandbox is a small package, which allows you to easily create a almost identical
environment like you had in your REPL, where you can experiment and try out different
things without worrying about breaking anything in original place, or polluting
global namespace.

License
--------

Sandobx is licensed with MIT license, which means that you can do pretty much everything with it.
